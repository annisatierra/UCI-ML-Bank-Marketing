# Investigating Bank Clients Deposit Behavior: A Descriptive and Predictive Analysis

## 1. Problem Statement
This project addresses the problems experienced by a Portuguese Bank regarding customer behavior in subscribing to time deposits. Banks certainly have high hopes for their customers to subscribe to term deposits. However, not all customers have the interest or inclination to do this. The marketing strategy that will be implemented by the bank also needs to be right on target in order to achieve marketing efficiency and effectiveness both in terms of energy and finances.

## 2. Dataset
Data taken from the UCI Machine Learning website entitled Bank Marketing (can be accessed at [this link](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/222/bank+marketing))

The data contains 45211 customer information with 17 variables including demographic information, savings accounts, and records of marketing treatment of related customers. On this occasion, only a few variables were selected that were considered relevant in solving the problem.

## 3. Problem Solving
We provide solutions in two forms of analysis, namely descriptive and predictive analysis.

**Descriptive Analysis** - 
This analysis is done by building an interactive dashboard using Tableau Public on customer data. This dashboard provides information and an overview of the characteristics of customers who choose to subscribe to term deposits and those who do not.

This dashboard can be accessed directly here at

**Predictive Analysis** -
So that banks can make decisions regarding customers who have the potential to subscribe to term deposits, a classification model using machine learning is created. The model used is the Gradient Boosting Classifier which produces an accuracy value of 88.43%.

## 4. Actionable Insights
From the two analyzes carried out, the bank is expected to be able to carry out a comprehensive assessment that collaborates both approaches. Descriptive analysis will help banks find out customer characteristics based on their deposit behavior. From these results, banks can determine the right form of marketing according to the general description of the customer's personality. Meanwhile, predictive analysis will be able to cut energy and costs in marketing because with the predictive model built, banks will be able to group customers who have the potential to subscribe to deposits. In other words, marketing will be more targeted and effective.
